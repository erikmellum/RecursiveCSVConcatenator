## Recursive CSV Concatenator

The solution to combining csv's from  multiple subdirectories into a single csv.

## Recursive CSV Concatenator Goals
1. Search all subdirectories for CSVs
2. Concatenate all CSVs into a single CSV

## How to use
1. Put the cat.sh script into the directory your subfolders are in
2. Open a terminal and run ./cat.sh
3. The combined csv will now be named all.csv in that same folder.

## Contributing

Limitations include not handling files with different columns nicely. Any contributions are appreciated. Please use the fork & pull model :).

Happy concatenating!
